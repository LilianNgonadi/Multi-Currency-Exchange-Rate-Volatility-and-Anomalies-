# Description

- This project aims to analyze the volatility and identify anomalies in the exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Nigerian Naira (NGN) over the period from 2001 to 2024. 
- By studying the fluctuations and unusual deviations in the exchange rates, the project seeks to uncover underlying economic factors and provide insights for stakeholders involved in financial planning, investment, and economic policy making

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project, titled "Multi-Currency Exchange Rate Volatility and Anomalies," is a comprehensive collection of historical exchange rate data for the US Dollar (USD) to the Nigerian Naira (NGN) over the period from 2000 to 2024. The dataset includes various attributes that capture the exchange rates and related metrics over this extensive period. Below is a detailed description of the dataset components:

- **Currency** :The currency pair involved in the exchange rate
- **Rate Year** : The year in which the exchange rate was recorded.
- **Rate Month**: The month in which the exchange rate was recorded.
- **Buying Rate** :Represents the cost in NGN to buy one currency.
- **Central Rate** :Used as a benchmark or reference rate for the currency pair
- **Selling Rate** :Represents the amount in NGN received for selling one currency

# Volatility Analysis

The table  below display the volatility of the US Dollar (USD) to Nigerian Naira (NGN) exchange rate from the year 2001 to 2024. The Volatility column measures the standard deviation of the exchange rate for each year, which indicates how much the exchange rate fluctuated during that year.

- Low Volatility Years: Years like 2001, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2017-2018 showed low volatility, meaning the USD/NGN exchange rate was relatively stable during those years.
- High Volatility Years: Years like 2003, 2013, 2020-2024 show very high volatility. Particularly, 2024 exhibits an exceptionally high volatility value of 225.71 suggesting extreme fluctuations in the exchange rate, which is due to economic instability, policy changes and other significant factors impacting the currency market.
